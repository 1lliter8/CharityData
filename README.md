# Charity Data
A learning project to pull all public sources of data on Charities in the United Kingdom together in one database.

My eventual aim is to enrich the data and create some dashboards to visualise it. I could also build a REST API or build a Django site.  

Who knows, maybe even a snappier name. The sky's the limit.

## Current progress

* Basic build and import of England/Wales database NOW WORKING!
