# Data investigation

One aim of this project was to use this dataset to learn and practise various data analysis and visualisation techniques. This folder will contain scripts and workbooks, likely both in R and Python, that illustrate this work.

## Files

### _connectscript.R

Quick script I can source in other workbooks to handle connecting to the database and throwing queries into dataframes.

### eew_firstlook_1.R

First pass, just working with England and Wales. Doing some rudimentary SQL queries into dataframes then visualising with ggplot2.
